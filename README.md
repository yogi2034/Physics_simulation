# Pygame-Pymunk Apple Game

This is a simple game created using the Pygame and Pymunk libraries in Python. It demonstrates the implementation of physics simulation and rendering using Pymunk, along with basic game development concepts using Pygame.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python (version 3.x)
- Pygame (version 2.x)
- Pymunk (version 7.x)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Ensure that all the required libraries are installed (see Prerequisites).
3. Run the `main.py` file using Python.

## Gameplay

- The game window will open with a gray background.
- Static black balls will be displayed at the bottom of the window.
- Clicking on the game window will create dynamic apple objects that fall down due to gravity.
- The apples will be displayed as images of apples (loaded from `apple2.png`).
- The apples will collide with the static balls and other apples.
- The game will continue until the window is closed.

## Controls

- Click anywhere on the game window to create an apple.
